                    <strong>What would you do differently with Melissa�s third � period class?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The right answer is: Have the lab at a later date so you can explain to the students how to use
                    critical thinking to solve a problem.
                    <br>

                    The students were frustrated in fist period because they were not accustomed to using critical
                    thinking to solve problems
                    in their classes. The students were used to having step by step instruction with the answer to the
                    lab incorporated in the
                    lab worksheet. The new way of thinking was unclear to them; they were not prepared to us a different
                    way of thinking.
                    As a teacher you should explain critical thinking and positive problem-solving altitude. Have the
                    students use the tool
                    that you taught them and have the lab at a later date.

                        Do you agree with Melissa�s initial idea that high school biology students should have
                        opportunities
                        to solve real-world problems and apply concepts?
                    </strong>

                    <br>
                    The right answer is: Yes, problem solving teaches students to develop their own creativity, thinking
                    skills, and communicative skills.
                    <br>

                    Teaching sciences or problem solving is challenging for all teachers. In problem solving, the
                    procedures and problems themselves may be left open for students to determine. Fostering students�
                    learning in the processes of science is an important goal of science teaching. Problem solving
                    teaches students to develop their own creativity, thinking skills, and communicative skills. Many
                    people fell that these skills may be more important than the learning of any particular science fact
                    or concepts.
